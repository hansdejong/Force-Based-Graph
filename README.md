# File Based Graph
## A Scala.js program

This repository started out by cloning the [Scala.js tutorial](http://www.scala-js.org/doc/tutorial.html), and also contains some exercises following the [Hands-on Scala.js](http://www.lihaoyi.com/hands-on-scala-js/) tutorial by Li Haoyi.

But then I started porting an Java-applet I once made, so that is the main application it has grown into. You can see it working here, [FBG](http://hansdejong.github.io/statics/fbg/fbg.html), on my [blog](http://hansdejong.github.io/).

Of course it is scala code (you cannot mix Scala and Java as in JVM-Scala), but I  started by using a [Java to Scala converter](http://javatoscala.com/).
The inspiration for the FBG came from this [blog](http://blog.ivank.net/force-based-graph-drawing-in-as3.html).

The planning is to make it more scala-ish, and to use it as a template for more applet-like programs. The plan is to port parts of a GA-program (genetic algorithm) I once made in Java.



For the GUI I used [webix](https://webix.com/tutorials/).
